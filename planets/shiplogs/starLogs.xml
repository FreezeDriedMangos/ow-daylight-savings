            <Text>Chert radioed me about a strange star that suddenly appeared in an otherwise empty patch of space 2,700 lightyears away. It has a strange luminosity profile - the star itself is nearly dead in the visible range, though the corona could belong to a regular star. Riebeck thinks its sudden appearance may be connected to the Nomai.</Text> <!-- The Text to display for this fact -->
